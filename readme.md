### yoLang
yoLang aims to be the most straightforward way to revise the 500 most common words in 
the most popular languages (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish). It's designed to be as simple as humanly possible.
I plan to cut all fluff in an extremist fashion code-wise and interface-wise.

**already implemented:**
+ signup, login, logout
+ english/german as language
+ no word repetition in session
+ basic ajax
+ basic validations
+ site text. completed for now.
+ basic I18n
+ tiny gamification feature
+ readme

p.s. If you happen to be a UI designer who would like to design a very, very minimalistic and nice interface for the app, just drop me a email: seikowsky@googlemail.com :)
