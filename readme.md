### yoLang
yoLang aims to be the most straightforward way to revise the 500 most common words in 
the most popular European languages (German, French, Italian, Spanish). It's designed to be as simple as possible. No fluff.
This is version1, which works and has German/English implemented. The other languages are to follow in version2 along with several
improvements and features.

**already implemented:**
+ signup, login, logout
+ english/german as language
+ no word repetition in session
+ basic ajax
+ basic validations
+ basic I18n
+ tiny gamification feature
+ readme
+ language swop feature

p.s. If you happen to be a UI designer who is interested in designing a very, very minimalistic, elegant interface for the app feel free to drop me an email: seikowsky@googlemail.com :)
