### yoLang
yoLang aims to be the most straightforward way to revise the 500 most common words in 
the most popular languages (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish). It's designed to be as simple as humanly possible.
I plan to cut all fluff in an extremist fashion code-wise and interface-wise.

**already implemented:**
+ signup, login, logout
+ english/german
+ basic ajax
+ no word repetition in session
+ validations

**to be implemented:**
+ no repetition of "known words"
+ tiny gamification feature
+ language flip feature
+ loading in background
+ more languages / dynamic language adding
+ basic test suite

p.s. If you happen to be a UI designer who would like to design an insanely minimalistic interface for the app, just drop me a email: seikowsky@googlemail.com
