### yoLang
yoLang aims to be the most straightforward way to revise the 500 most common words in 
the most popular languages (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish). It's designed to be as simple as humanly possible.
I plan to cut all fluff in an extremist fashion code-wise and interface-wise.

**already implemented:**
+ signup, login, logout
+ english/german
+ basic ajax
+ no word repetition in session
+ validations

**to be implemented:**
+ language flip feature
+ i18n
+ more languages
+ loading in background (research)
+ basic test suite
+ other blacklist items

p.s. If you happen to be a UI designer who would like to design a very, very minimalistic and nice interface for the app, just drop me a email: seikowsky@googlemail.com :)
